In the directory /python, we put all the python scripts that implement some step or functionality of the overall flow.

For instance, there will be a script that implements the program cli interface, or a script that implements the functions needed to evaluate the different classifiers.

All python code, except the main.py file, that is the one that will be directly executed, will be placed here.
